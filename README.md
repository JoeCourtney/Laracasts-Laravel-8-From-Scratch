<p>This is a repository following the progress of the <a href="https://laracasts.com/">Laracasts</a> series, <strong><a href="https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/">Laravel 8 from Scratch</a></strong>.

<p>I am putting this repository together for free on my own time in order to help others who may be going through this course, as there are currently no uploaded course files. I am in no way affiliated with Laracasts, other than using their amazing courses.</p>

<p>There will be one commit per episode so that students can easily pick up at the beginning of any episode.</p>

<p>More information on the Laravel framework can be found <a href="https://laravel.com/">here</a>.
